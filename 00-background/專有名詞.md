MROM | Mask ROM
OTP | One-Time Programmable (OTP) Memory
PRCI | (Power, Reset, Clock, Interrupt) is an umbrella term for platform non-AON memorymapped control and status registers controlling component power states, resets, clock selection, and low-level interrupts, hence the name. The AON block contains registers with similar functions, but only for the AON block units

BHT | Branch History Table
BTB  | Branch Target Buffer
RAS  | Return-Address Stack
CLINT  | Core-Local Interruptor. Generates per-hart software interrupts and timer
interrupts.
CLIC  | Core-Local Interrupt Controller. Configures priorities and levels for core local interrupts.
hart  | Hardware Thread
DTIM  | Data Tightly Integrated Memory
ITIM  | Instruction Tightly Integrated Memory
JTAG  | Joint Test Action Group
LIM  | Loosely Integrated Memory. Used to describe memory space delivered in a SiFive Core Complex but not tightly integrated to a CPU core.
PMP  | Physical Memory Protection
PLIC  | Platform-Level Interrupt Controller. The global interrupt controller in a RISC-V system.
TileLink  | A free and open interconnect standard originally developed at UC Berkeley.
RO  | Used to describe a Read Only register field.
RW  | Used to describe a Read/Write register field.
WO  | Used to describe a Write Only registers field.
WARL  | Write-Any Read-Legal field. A register field that can be written with any value, but returns only supported values when read.
WIRI  | Writes-Ignored, Reads-Ignore field. A read-only register field reserved for future use. Writes to the field are ignored, and reads should ignore the value returned.
WLRL | Write-Legal, Read-Legal field. A register field that should only be written with legal values and that only returns legal value if last written with a legal value.
WPRI | Writes-Preserve Reads-Ignore field. A register field that might contain unknown information. Reads should ignore the value returned, but writes to the whole register should preserve the original value.
IJTP |  indirect-jump target predictor (IJTP);
RAS | return-address stack (RAS),
HPM | hardware performance monitoring (HPM)
MSI | message-​signaled interrupts (MSI)
