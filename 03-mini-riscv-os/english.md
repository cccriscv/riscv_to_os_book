# mini-riscv-os 

Build a minimal multi-tasking OS kernel for RISC-V from scratch

Mini-riscv-os was inspired by [jserv](https://github.com/jserv)'s [mini-arm-os](https://github.com/jserv/mini-arm-os) project.

However, [ccckmit](https://github.com/ccckmit) rewrite the project for RISC-V, and run on Win10 instead of Linux.

## Build & Run on Windows 10

* [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [FreedomStudio](https://www.sifive.com/software)

After download and extract the FreedomStudio for windows. You have to set the system PATH to the folder of `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc/bin` and `riscv-qemu/bin`. For example, I set PATH to the following folders. 

```
D:\install\FreedomStudio-2020-06-3-win64\SiFive\riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2020.04.1\bin

D:\install\FreedomStudio-2020-06-3-win64\SiFive\riscv-qemu-4.2.0-2020.04.0\bin
```

And you should start your git-bash to build the project. (It works for me in vscode bash terminal)

## Steps

* [01-HelloOs](01-HelloOs)
  - Enable UART to print trivial greetings
* [02-ContextSwitch](02-ContextSwitch)
  - Basic switch from OS to user task
* [03-MultiTasking](03-MultiTasking)
  - Two user tasks are interatively switching
* [04-TimerInterrupt](04-TimerInterrupt)
  - Enable SysTick for future scheduler implementation
* [05-Preemptive](05-Preemptive)
  - Basic preemptive scheduling

## Building and Verification

* Changes the current working directory to the specified one and then

```
make
make qemu
```
